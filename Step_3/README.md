# Personal Docker Project

The purpose of this second step is to "enhance" the JBoss container.

As someone who's setup and maintained production Java EE containers it's been my experience that you always need to add a few libraries to the container itself.

A good example are JDBC drivers.  I generally add the application JDBC jars directly to the J2EE container because it makes the drivers avaible to all applications running on the Java EE container.  (I have *never* seen an instance where two applications running on the same container needed seperate versions of a JDBC driver.)

Another example is MQ Series from IBM.  I once set up a Tomcat server but I found a three MQ jars which could not be deployed as part of the application.  For some reason the classloader would not recognize the jars unless they were deployed with the Tomcat server itself.  (I never did figure out why?)

So, in this step we're going to download a few Oracle drivers from Maven Centeral, then we're going to copy these jars into the JBoss ./lib directory so they will be avaiable to all applications running on this JBoss installation.

## Detailed Explanation

###  pom.xml
The starting point for this web service was the Spring IO Initiilazer.  The generated pom, however, was not initially compatiable with JBoss.  Therefore, several (very minor) modifications were required.  

Mois√©s Macero has a superb article on now to make the necessary modifications to get a Spring Boot micro service running under JBoss.

```

Naturally, the formatting of the pom was brought up to my specifications.

###  Dockerfile
The Dockerfile for this step is also very short.  We set up everything in prevsion steps.

The only work to do here is to move the newly generated war file into the containers deployment directory.

```text
# Copy the Java Jar files into the JBoss ./lib directory.
COPY target/sb-jboss-example*.war     /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/SpringBootJboss.war
```

## Update The Image On Docker Hub
You're going to need to push this new image to Docker Hub.  This image will be used in Step 3.

```text
docker push codewarrior23/personal-repository:wildfly-step3
```

## Running The Image
Okay, it starts and it runs!

To start the container run this at the command line:

```text
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990  -it   codewarrior23/personal-repository:wildfly-step3
```

To hit the web service use this URL:
```text
http://localhost:8080/SpringBootJboss/hi
```

Additionally, you should be able to look at the JBoss Administration Console here (remember the userid/password is admin/admin):

```text
http://localhost:9990/console/index.html
```

Also, if you just want to look around, you can use the following command to launch
as Bash prompt.  

```text
docker run  -it   codewarrior23/personal-repository:wildfly-step2 bash
```

## Finished!
That's it.  Very well done!  From here, you can take this simple web servcie and start expanding on it!

Good Luck!
